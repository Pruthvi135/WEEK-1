Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

Overview

This project is designed to assist in recommending suitable crops and fertilizers based on key soil and environmental parameters. It leverages a machine learning-based approach to ensure accurate predictions, ultimately aiding in sustainable agriculture.

Problem Statement

The primary goal is to develop a system that:
-Predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil composition and climatic conditions.
-Recommends appropriate fertilizers to optimize yield and soil health.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains 2,200 samples and includes the following features:

Features
Data Analysis: Performs basic analysis on the crop dataset.
Missing Data Visualization: Displays missing data using a heatmap.
Value Count Analysis: Allows checking the value counts of columns.
Dynamic File Handling: Supports loading data from CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.
Logging: Tracks important actions and errors in the analysis.

Dataset Insights:

The dataset has no missing or duplicate values.
Each crop category is balanced, with 100 samples per class.
Features exhibit a diverse range of values, ensuring variability.

Predictor Variables:

-N (Nitrogen): Nitrogen content in the soil (mg/kg).
-P (Phosphorus): Phosphorus content in the soil (mg/kg).
-K (Potassium): Potassium content in the soil (mg/kg).
-Temperature: Atmospheric temperature (°C).
-Humidity: Relative humidity (%).
-pH: Soil pH level (acidity or alkalinity).
-Rainfall: Annual rainfall (mm).
